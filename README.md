## 📖 About this repository
Welcome to the epicenter of electrical engineering!
Here we archive everything that worked in class—and sometimes even what didn't.

* **Goal:** Find tasks faster than the Arduino boots up.
* **Format:** Code, explanations, and images so that even the LED knows what to do.
* **Get involved:** If you can do it better: Pull Request → Become a legend 😎
